# Sentimental-Analysis-Prediction-On-Twitter-Data-Using-Machine-Learning-Classifiers
In this project, we worked on a dataset comprising of tweets for 6 major US Airlines and performed a multi-class sentiment analysis. This approach starts off with pre-processing techniques used to clean the tweets and then representing these tweets as vectors. The analysis was carried out using four different classification strategies: SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Na√Øve Bayes. The classifiers were trained using 75% of the data and tested using the remaining 15% data. The outcome of the test set is the tweet sentiment (positive/negative/neutral). Based on the results obtained, the accuracies were calculated to do a comparison between each classification approach.
